## v3.0.0

The 3.0.0 release moves from react-apollo@2.x to @apollo scoped packages. This adds hook support for queries. For more, see: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/hooks-migration/#breaking-changes

A codemod will handle replacing the relevant packages and imports. Tests will need to be manually updated to use `act` to support hooks.
